## Create a while loop that starts with x = 0 and increments x until x is equal to 5. Each iteration should print to the console

x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x+1)
    x = x+1
    print("All systems go")
    
    
## Question 2:loop above skips printing x = 5 to the console but will print values of x from 6 to 10
